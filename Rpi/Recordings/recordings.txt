dish3.wav - a recording using the electret microphone mounted on the dish pointing away from the dish (this should mitigate the affect of the dish - polarity reversed

dish2_2.wav - a recording using the electret microphone pointing towards the dish as expected (this should use the geometry dish for amplification - polarity reversed

dish2.wav - a recording using the electret microphone pointing towards the dish as expected

pc2.wav - a recording using a pc microphone located in approximately the same space as the dish pointing away from dish.

pc2_and_dish.wav - a recording using a pc microphone located in same spot as electret microphone pointing towards the dish.

Note about the  Volume comparison and Frequency Analysis screenshots.

-I recorded bird songs playing out of my computer from a youtube link

-There was occasionally some background noise. I tried to not compare parts of the file that included background noise.

-At one point I actually yelled in the microphone. I avoided using this part in the analysis.

Observations: 
-The parabolic dish affects the frequency range the microphone accepts, mostly it cuts down on the high dB peaks (see screenshots of frequency analysis).

-The parabolic dish affects the overall gain of the microphone very little. If anything it acts as a rain shield.
